Welcome to the Correlated Potentialistics wiki!


Correlated Potentialistics (herein probably going to just be called "this mod", since that is a *long* name) is a mod based around the digitization of items. This wiki is written mainly for people who are already familiar with Applied Energistics, the mod this one is inspired by. Even still, we will go over some topics that are identical to their analogues in AE.

Note that anyone can edit this wiki, *this includes you*! If the pages are missing anything or have inaccurate information, feel free to fix it! You can also add screenshots of things you've made under the Examples section of the page (if it doesn't have one, go ahead and add one!)

## Blocks

* [[Controller]] - The heart of any storage system in this mod.
* [[Drive Bay]] - Holds up to 8 drives, requires a Controller.
* [[Terminal]] - Lets you access the system.
* [[Interface]] - Allows machinery to access the system.
* Router (coming soon) - Endpoint for Ethernet cables.
* Ethernet Cable (coming soon) - Allows connecting two Routers together.

## Items

* [[Drive]] - A basic hard drive, holds digitized items for later retrieval.
* [[Enderic Processor]] - Where do you find these?

## Mechanics

* [[Storage Math]] - Yes, it's extremely similar to AE2.
