Welcome to the Correlated Potentialistics wiki!


Correlated Potentialistics (herein probably going to just be called "this mod", since that is a *long* name) is a mod based around the digitization of items. This wiki is written mainly for people who are already familiar with Applied Energistics, the mod this one is inspired by. Even still, we will go over some topics that are identical to their analogues in AE.

## Blocks

* [[Controller]] - The heart of any storage system in this mod.
* [[Drive Bay]] - Holds up to 8 drives, requires a Controller.
* [[Terminal]] - Lets you access the system.
* Interface (coming soon) - Allows machinery to access the system.
* Access Point (coming soon) - Allows connections from Wireless Terminals.

## Items

* [[Drive]] - A basic hard drive, holds digitized items for later retrieval.
* [[Enderic Processor]] - Where do you find these?
* Wireless Terminal (coming soon) - Lets you access your system, *wirelessly*!

## Mechanics

* [[Storage Math]] - Yes, it's extremely similar to AE2.
* [[Networks]] - Where's the cables?
