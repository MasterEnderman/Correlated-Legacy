### Controller

This is the core of a Correlated system. It accepts power for the network and performs Correlated Multitasking. A network cannot function without this.

### Drive Bay

This connects all hard drives to the network for the controller to store coordinate positions to. A network cannot function without this and at least one hard drive. Insert hard drives by right-clicking on an empty slot with a hard drive, and right-click with an empty hand on a slot that has a hard drive to remove the drive. A Drive Bay can hold eight hard drives.

### Memory Bay

This connects all memory chips to the network for the controller to process coordinate positions with. A network cannot function without this and at least one memory chip. Insert memory by right-clicking on an empty slot with a memory chip, and right-click with an empty hand on a slot that has a memory chip to remove the chip. A Memory Bay can hold twelve memory chips.


### Terminal

A screen to access the network and all the items stored within. It is not mandatory for a functional network, but is recommended for general item access.

### Handheld Terminal

A portable, wireless screen to access the network and all the items stored within. It is not mandatory for a functional network, and requires an APN to operate (see the Wireless section).

### Interface

This block will retrieve any amount of any items specified from the network and store the items in the physical world, so the items can be accessed by nearby inventories. Any items inserted into the interface that are not specified to be stored will be automatically inserted into the network.

### Wireless

Wireless systems can connect handheld terminals to networks or networks to other networks. A wireless network is connected together by its APN, or Access Point Name. To connect to a network from another network, right-click the controller and select the APN you wish to connect to.

There are three methods of transmitting wireless connections:
- Optical Transceivers are power-efficient but are short range and can only connect to systems in line of sight.
- Beacon Lenses use bleeding-edge technology to harness the power of Beacons. They are placed on top of an active beacon and can connect to anywhere within the beacon's range, even without line of sight. They will not obstruct the beacon beam, but will not work if the beam is blocked overhead.
- Microwave Beams have infinite range, but use a lot of power and only work within line of sight. They do not use APNs, but must be paired manually by using them on each other. These cannot be used to connect to handheld terminals.
