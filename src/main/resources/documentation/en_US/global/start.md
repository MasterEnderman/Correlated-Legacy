# Getting Started with

# CoMDOS

The first step to setting up a CoMDOS system is to create Luminous Pearls. These pearls will be essential for fabricating many components of the system, including (but not limited to) the system controller, the access terminal, and memory cards. Storage requires both drive space and memory, so drive platters will need to be created from fired clay, and iron for higher-density storage. Once disk drives and memory chips have been created, they should be inserted in drive bays and memory bays, respectively. Finally, to complete a controller and terminal, you will require a processor core. These can be mail<!-- fuzz 1 -->ordered from Cor<!-- fuzz 3 -->ated Logistic<!-- fuzz 5 -->. (A/N: The final method to obtain a processor core is NYI. You can find it in dungeon chests until it's implemented.)

## WARNING:

We are legally obligated to advise you to not store luminous pearls near nether portals. If they come in contact with these portals, especially at high velocity, they can <!-- fuzz 24 --> and <!-- fuzz 16 -->. If these pearls are created, SAFELY DISPOSE OF THEM IMMEDIATELY, as they may <!-- fuzz 8 --> *<!-- fuzz 8 -->* **<!-- fuzz 8 -->**

(A/N: There is currently no proper way to return from the Unstable Pearl dimension, and the dimension is not yet properly generating. All your player data is backed up and no items or experience will be lost, so jump into the void to return home.)
