# How To Use This Handbook

The first thing you'll want to know is that the documentation pages go past the end of the screen. For touch model handbooks, you can drag up or down to move the screen. Otherwise, for a keyboard you can use [any keys supported by Unix man](/manhtkys), most notably Space. If you have a mouse, the middle wheel will also scroll.

In the top-left, two buttons can be found for going to the previous or next document in your history. If you have a keyboard connected, you may also press Alt+Left Arrow or Alt+Right Arrow, respectively. If you have a mouse connected to your Handbook, you may also use the thumb buttons. The front one goes forward, and, fittingly, the back one goes back.

You may occasionally see [underlined text](/meta) in the documentation. Clicking or tapping such text will take you to another document, though in this specific case, it links to the same document. Clicking that will simply take you to the top of this document.

For simplicity, in the rest of the documentation we will refer to tapping or clicking together as just "clicking". Please do not attempt to use a mouse with a touch model handbook.

That's the end of this document. Please navigate back to the index to learn more about your CoMDOS system.
