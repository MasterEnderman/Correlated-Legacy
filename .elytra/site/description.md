**Note**: A lot of the features described in the below blurb are still a work
in progress. The storage portion of the mod is effectively complete, but the
rest is still very unfinished.

Correlated is a digital storage and automation mod, featuring DOSpunk elements.
Venture through abandoned technology ruins, only to steal the power source and
use it to store all your items. Explore a detailed backstory about a wildly
successful 80s computing company that mysteriously vanished only a few years
into their success. Read extremely detailed and easily explored ingame
documentation, all written in-character by the company behind Correlated
Multitasking. Wire your base with an involved and fun wireless system, and
access it from anywhere. Go a step further and fill your world with wireless
access points, based on beacons, and *truly* access your system from anywhere.

Correlated was created in March 2016 as a clone of Applied Energistics, but
since then has turned into a general content mod, centered around its storage
system and related computers. It's an attempt to take the generic digital
storage mod archetype, and give it some personality.

Boss fights. Programming. Robotic uprisings. Tiny robots to do your bidding.
Lots and lots of glowing. Unity-inspired beautiful textures. Dungeons. Hacking.
Try Correlated today; you might just like it.
