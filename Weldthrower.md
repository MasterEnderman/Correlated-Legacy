The Weldthrower is part wrench, part welder, and part flamethrower. It has two uses, the first is to disassemble network parts instantly, which can be done by shift-rightclicking a network part while holding it.

The second is to shoot sparks, which set fire to and damage anything in front of you. To do this, you must have Weldthrower Fuel in your inventory. When right-clicking, the weldthrower will consume one fuel and fire a blast of sparks forward.
