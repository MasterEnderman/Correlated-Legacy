**Note that the Drive Bay is simply a holder for drives. The [[Controller]] does all the heavy lifting, and if you want to read about priority and ordering logic, you will want to go to that page.**

The Drive Bay is an essential part of any network, allowing you to expose the storage of Drives to the system. It will hold up to 8 drives, and consumes 8 RF/t on it's own.

The Drive Bay also offers a convenient at-a-glance view of all the drives in your system and their current status. The colored light on the front of each drive will fade from green to red as the drive fills. (Void Drives will simply pulse between shades of purple.) In addition, if a drive is named on an anvil, you can look at it while it's mounted in the drive bay to show its name.

The Drive Bay **does not** have a GUI, and as such, the way to insert drives is to hold the drive and right-click on an empty slot on the Drive Bay's front face. You can do the same to a filled slot while holding anything to take the drive out.
