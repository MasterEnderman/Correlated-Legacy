The Wireless Transmitter opens up a network's contents to wireless access, via a Wireless Receiver or Wireless Terminal.

A Wireless Transmitter can be placed anywhere connected to a network, which will allow you to link Receivers and Terminals to it by right-clicking. The lights on the baseplate will glow green if you did it correctly.

Transmitters have a maximum range of 64 blocks. If you need more, you can build wireless extenders, consisting of a controller, a wireless receiver, and another transmitter.

The Wireless Receiver links a network with another, **one-way**. The network with the receiver will be able to see and modify items in the linked network, but not vice-versa. Before placing a Receiver, you need to link it with a Transmitter by right-clicking on it. Once placed, if the Receiver can find the Transmitter, it will point toward it and glow green. If it cannot find the Transmitter, it will start spinning and turn red.

The Wireless Terminal is a wireless variant of the [[Terminal]]. It acts much in the same way, but must be linked to a  transmitter in the same way as a Receiver.
