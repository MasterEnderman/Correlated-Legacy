The Terminal allows you to directly access the storage of a system. When right-clicked, it will open a GUI showing every item in the system, sorted by quantity. The search bar in the top right will allow you to search for items containing a literal case-insensitive string.

Possible actions are:

* **Left-click**, remove 1 stack from the network
* **Right-click**, remove 1 item from the network
* **Shift left-click**, remove 1 stack from the network, directly into inventory
* **Shift right-click**, remove 1 item from the network, directly into inventory
* **Drop key**, remove 1 item from the network, onto the floor
* **Ctrl+drop key**, remove 1 stack from the network, onto the floor

The last one can be very useful for emptying out drives.

## Sorting Modes

On either side of the search bar, there are buttons allowing you to set your sorting preference. This is unique per-terminal and per-user.

The left button allows you to set the sorting mode, while the right button sets direction. The possible sorting modes are:

* **Quantity** ( % ) - Items are sorted by the amount stored in the system, and items with the same quantity are sorted alphabetically by name.
* **Originating Mod (Minecraft First)** ( @ ) - Items are sorted alphabetically by which mod they are from, with items from vanilla showing up first. Items from the same mod are sorted alphabetically by name.
* **Originating Mod** ( @! ) - Identical to Originating Mod (Minecraft First), but without vanilla being treated specially.
* **Name** ( AZ ) - Items are sorted alphabetically by name.
