The Terminal allows you to directly access the storage of a system. When right-clicked, it will open a GUI showing every item in the system, sorted by quantity. The search bar in the top right will allow you to search for items containing a literal case-insensitive string.

Possible actions are:

* **Left-click**, remove 1 stack from the network
* **Right-click**, remove 1 item from the network
* **Shift left-click**, remove 1 stack from the network, directly into inventory
* **Shift right-click**, remove 1 item from the network, directly into inventory
* **Drop key**, remove 1 item from the network, onto the floor
* **Ctrl+drop key**, remove 1 stack from the network, onto the floor

The last one can be very useful for emptying out drives.
