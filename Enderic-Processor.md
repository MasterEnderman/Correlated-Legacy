# ![](https://i.imgur.com/IvUKlIy.png) Enderic Processor

An Enderic Processor is a mysterious processor left behind by the same unknown forerunners as the strongholds, dungeons, and nether fortresses. As such, it can only be found in the chests in those structures. You can create more once you have at least one with 2 Nether Quartz, 2 Gold Ingots, 1 Ender Pearl, and 1 Diamond.
